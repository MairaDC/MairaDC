# 👋 Working with me - user manual to Maira (she/her)
This page is intended to help others understand what it might be like to work with me, especially people who haven’t worked with me before. It's also a well-intentioned effort at building some trust by being intentionally vulnerable, and to share my ideas of a good working relationship to reduce the anxiety of people who might be on my team.

## 🕤 Time zone and working hours
- My working days are monday-tuesday & thursday-friday, _wednesday is my day off(line)_
- I work remote between 08.30 - 17.30 (Amsterdam time) from home and Xpirit HQ (NL)
- I do not check email, work, or respond to work-related messages on days off, holidays, evenings and the weekends.

## 📫 Communication preferences
Communicate. If there's a problem or you're blocked on something, please bring it up. I'll generally interpret silence as "everything's fine".
- **I prefer to communicate via written messages** (email, slack or teams will do) I highly dislike phone calls, because I need time to process information and feel rushed to repsond.
- **Need me to respond quickly?** send me a text message (only call if something is on fire 🔥).
- **I don’t have unscheduled meetings**. My weeks are packed with training, workshops and customer work. I protect my time and manage my energy levels: In order to do my best work (creating scripts, workshops, etc), I need long stretches of time to think and focus. Unscheduled calls are interruptions for me.

## My working style
- **I like explicit tasks.** I’m better at helping when I have a good idea of what you need. “Take a look” is less helpful than “I’m looking for feedback on X and Y, by end of month”.
- **Transparency is very important to me.** Please work with short toes, no ego, and a low level of shame.
- **If I disagree with you, I may try to steer you down a different path.** But me disagreeing with you doesn’t mean that you’re doing something wrong.
- **Please do not take offense to periods of silence.** I prefer long, uninterrupted windows of time to work. I disable all notifications on my laptop and my phone. This allows me to focus deeply on one task at a time, which is a more efficient way of working than attempting to multitask.
- **I need recovery time after social events.** After trainings and workshops I go offline to recover from a social hangover and focus on individual work.
